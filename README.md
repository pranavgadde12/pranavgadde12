Hi, I’m Pranav Gadde (@pranavgadde12)
I am an Automation and Data Analyst with experience designing secure, approval-driven workflows and building end-to-end “intake-to-system-of-record” automation in regulated environments. My work focuses on eliminating manual, spreadsheet-driven processes and replacing them with auditable, scalable, API-integrated systems.
My background spans financial compliance, enterprise reporting, and large-scale data operations. I specialize in structuring raw inputs, enforcing data quality, automating approvals, and producing analytics-ready datasets that support operational and leadership decision-making.

Areas of Interest
AI-driven and rules-based workflow automation
Enterprise system integrations (HR, finance, analytics)
Data pipelines, validation frameworks, and reporting automation
Compliance-aware system design and audit readiness

Current Focus

Project: Automated Financial Compliance & Reporting Pipeline
Description
This project simulates an enterprise-grade automation system inspired by real-world workflows in regulated banking environments. The solution replaces manual, spreadsheet-driven compliance and reporting processes with a structured, auditable, and analytics-ready data pipeline.
The system is designed to handle sensitive financial and compliance-related data while enforcing role-based approvals, validation rules, and traceability — reflecting the operational standards used in FDIC-regulated financial institutions.

Business Problem
In traditional banking operations, compliance checks, financial reconciliations, and regulatory reports often rely on manual Excel files, email approvals, and disconnected systems. This leads to delays, data inconsistencies, limited audit visibility, and increased operational risk.

This project addresses those challenges by automating intake, validation, approval routing, reporting, and audit logging within a unified workflow.
Architecture Overview
1. Structured Data Intake
   Financial or compliance requests (e.g., transaction review, account exception, audit query) are captured through a structured input form. Mandatory fields and validation rules ensure data consistency at the point of entry.
2. Data Processing & Validation Engine
   A Python-based processing layer cleans, normalizes, and validates incoming data. Business rules are applied to detect anomalies, duplicates, threshold breaches, and missing attributes before further processing.
3. Approval & Exception Routing
   Using conditional logic, requests are routed for approval based on risk level, transaction value, or compliance category.
   Low-risk items follow an automated path, while flagged cases are escalated for manual compliance review.
4. Analytics & Reporting Layer
   Cleaned and approved data is transformed into analysis-ready datasets. Automated reports and KPIs track: Compliance exception rates, Approval turnaround times, High-risk transaction frequency, Operational workload trends
These outputs support management reporting and regulatory reviews.
5. Audit Logging & Governance
   Every action — submission, validation, approval, and update — is time-stamped and logged.
   Audit-ready datasets and standardized reports are generated to support SOX, AML, and internal audit requirements.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, data validation, transformation)
SQL (reporting queries and aggregations)
Advanced Excel (Power Query, reconciliation logic)
REST API simulation for system-of-record updates
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) logic
Automated report generation and documentation

Key Outcomes
1. Eliminated manual spreadsheet dependency
2. Improved data accuracy and consistency
3. Reduced manual intervention in recurring workflows
4. Enabled audit-ready, traceable reporting
5. Created a scalable foundation for analytics and automation

Relevance
This project reflects real-world banking operations involving financial reporting, compliance monitoring, and data governance. The same architecture can be extended to HR systems, marketing automation, CRM analytics, or enterprise workflow platforms.
